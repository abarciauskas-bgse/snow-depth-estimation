# TODOs

- run inference on multiple items
- decide methodology for comparison across time
- add more data
- organize notebooks + methodology

# Nice to haves:

- maybe add back in elevation (very slow to add via API)
- find out if there is a way to get longer history of SNOTEL data
- for HLS data
  - figure out if FMask is being interpreted correctly
  - investigate B08 - some scenes have it and some don't
