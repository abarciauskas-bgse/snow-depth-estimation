# Short-term todos

- run inference...

# TODOs

- organize notebooks + methodology

# Nice to haves:

- maybe add back in elevation (can't use it while data is in native projection)
- find out if there is a way to get longer history of SNOTEL data
- for HLS data
  - figure out if FMask is being interpreted correctly
  - investigate B08 - some scenes have it and some don't
